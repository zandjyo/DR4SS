\title{Fit age predictor (survey Q3 backbone + fishery quarter delta + priors)}
\usage{
fit_age_predictor(
  fish_dt,
  srv_dt,
  maxage = 12L,
  min_n_cell = 30L,
  prior_mix = 0.7
)
}
\arguments{
\item{fish_dt}{Fishery aged data (from get_fishery_age_wt_data()).
Must include YEAR, QUARTER, LENGTH (cm), AGE, SEX (F/M), AREA.}

\item{srv_dt}{Survey aged data (from GET_SURV_AGE()).
Must include YEAR, LENGTH_MM (mm), AGE, SEX (F/M). All records are Q3.}

\item{maxage}{Plus-group maximum age.}

\item{min_n_cell}{Minimum aged fish in a cell to use cell prior (else pooled).}

\item{prior_mix}{Mixing weight for cell prior vs pooled prior.}
}
\value{
A list with fitted models and prior tables.
}
\description{
Call this once, then pass the returned object to predict_age_from_lf().
