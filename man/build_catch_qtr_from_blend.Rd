\title{Build quarterly catch weights from blend catch output}
\usage{
build_catch_qtr_from_blend(blend_catch, by_gear = FALSE, complete_grid = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{blend_catch}{A data.frame/data.table with at least YEAR, MONTH_WED, and TONS.
If \code{by_gear=TRUE}, must also contain GEAR (e.g., "HAL","POT","TRW"/other).}

\item{by_gear}{Logical. If TRUE, compute catch proportions by gear group (GEAR2)
within each year. Gear mapping: 1 = other/trawl, 2 = HAL, 3 = POT.}

\item{complete_grid}{Logical. If TRUE, fill in missing quarters with CATCH=0 and p_q=0.}

\item{use_retained}{Optional character vector of RETAINED_OR_DISCARDED codes to keep
(e.g., c("R") to keep retained only). Default NULL keeps all (retained+discarded).}
}
\value{
A data.table with columns:
\itemize{
\item YEAR (int)
\item QUARTER (int 1-4)
\item CATCH (numeric; summed TONS)
\item p_q (numeric; within-year proportion)
\item GEAR2 (int) if by_gear=TRUE
}
}
\description{
Converts monthly blend catch (from COUNCIL.COMPREHENSIVE_BLEND_CA) into quarterly
catch totals and within-year proportions suitable for catch-weighting EWAA.
