\title{Turn a long data frame of weight-at-age data into a wide data frame by age}
\usage{
weight_at_age_wide(
  dat,
  value = c("weight", "length", "count"),
  maxage = 10,
  fleet_id = 1,
  seas = 1,
  gender = 1,
  GP = 1,
  bseas = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{A data frame created from \code{\link[=weight_at_age_read]{weight_at_age_read()}} or one that has the
following column names: Source, Weight_kg, Age_yrs, Length_cm, Month, Year.}

\item{value}{A character value specifying which type of data you are
interested in. The options include \code{"weight"}, \code{"length"}, and \code{"count"},
where the latter returns sample sizes.}

\item{maxage}{The age of the plus-group bin. Default is 10.}

\item{fleet_id}{Integer fleet code to attach to all rows (typical usage when
writing a single aggregated series). Default is 1.}

\item{seas, gender, GP, bseas}{Stock Synthesis metadata fields (defaults 1).}
}
\value{
A data frame with columns \verb{#Yr, seas, gender, GP, bseas, fleet, a0..amaxage}.
Ages with no samples are \code{NA}. If \code{value="count"}, values are sample sizes.
}
\description{
Take long-format (raw) weight-at-age data and create a Stock Synthesis-style
wide matrix with columns a0..amaxage and the required SS metadata columns.
