\title{Calculate AFSC/AKFIN-style week-ending dates (Saturday)}
\usage{
WED(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A vector of dates or date-times coercible by lubridate to dates
(e.g., \code{Date}, \code{POSIXct}). If \code{x} is not already a Date, it
will be interpreted via lubridate/date coercion as used by
\code{\link[lubridate]{ceiling_date}} and \code{\link[lubridate]{year}}.}
}
\value{
A \code{Date} vector of the same length as \code{x}, giving the
computed week-ending (Saturday) date for each element.
}
\description{
Computes the "week-ending date" used in many AFSC/AKFIN workflows, returning
a Saturday week-end date for each input date. This implementation follows a
historical convention change around 1993 and includes safeguards to prevent
week-ending dates from crossing calendar years.
}
\details{
The algorithm:
\enumerate{
\item Computes \code{wed = ceiling_date(x, "week")}.
\item Converts \code{wed} to the Saturday associated with the input date by
adding \code{-1} day for most weekdays and \code{+6} days when the
input date is a Sunday.
\item For years prior to 1993, uses \code{date(wed)} directly (legacy rule).
\item If the resulting week-ending date crosses into a different year than
the input, clamps the week-ending date to December 31 of the input year.
}

This function is intended to match existing legacy weekly binning behavior in
historical data pulls. If you need a simple ISO-like "end of week" calculation
without legacy adjustments, use a separate helper instead.
